# Solutions for Advent of Code

Decided to have a go at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year. I'll be solving everything using Rust, and creating as simple and clean solutions as possible. I have not benchmarked these solutions, but I am trying to create fairly fast solutions.

### Running the solutions

Run a solution by `cd`-ing into its directory and invoke the program with Cargo:

```
$ cd 2018/01
$ cargo run < input/input.txt
```
